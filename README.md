# VCENet
This is the Vibration Comfort Evaluation Network (VCENet) repo based on the study:
Du, X., Sun, C., Zheng, Y., Feng, X., & Li, N. (2020). Evaluation of vehicle vibration comfort using deep learning. Measurement, 108634.

It will be updated continually by adding new material, i.e. the data, code and the final model for a possible online APP.
